Dipping my toes back into SSGs to build up a new UX Portfolio. all the cool kids seem to use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) & [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), so Imma give that a whirl.

I forked [Nikita Zanella](https://github.com/NikitaZanella/)'s [Starter template](https://github.com/NikitaZanella/11ty-SASS) because it was a nice combo of preconfiguration and room for customization. I highly recommend it. Check out the [starter example](https://11ty-sass.netlify.app/), or head on over to [craiggieselman.com](https://craiggieselman.com/) and take a peek at how I customized it.
