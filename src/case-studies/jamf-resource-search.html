          <p>
            Jamf.com’s Resources section had functional limitations and
            usability issues. Because it is such a high profile section of the
            website we needed an improved experience for users to more easily
            find relevant resources. Another aspect of the high profile nature
            was a large number of stakeholders. We took care in addressing and
            testing each requirement, but only those that fared well in testing
            made it to the final solution.

          <h2>The Problem</h2>

          <p>
            The legacy solution to browsing Resources consisted of 2 input
            selects… One that showed all of Jamf’s products and one that showed
            the types of Resources we had available. The user would select an
            option from one (or both) input selects and hit a Search button to
            display results.
          </p>

          <figure aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
            <picture>
              <source srcset="/img/resources-legacy.webp" type="image/webp" />
              <source srcset="/img/resources-legacy.png" type="image/png" />
              <img src="/img/resources-legacy.png" class="bordered" alt="" />
            </picture>
            <figcaption>
              The legacy solution had functional limitations and usability
              issues.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The limited functionality of the 2 input selects included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The lack of search field to type keywords or phrases to search.
            </li>
            <li>
              It had only 2 filters, Limiting the ability to narrow results.
            </li>
            <li>No sorting options were available.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This solution also presented usability issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can’t see the filter options unless the input select is open.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the back button would take you to your last form action, but
              did not reset the form fields.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Team & Role</h2>

          <p>
            The Resources section is a very highly trafficked sections of
            <a
              href="https://www.jamf.com"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Jamf.com</a
            >. Because of this, many individuals took interest in the project.
            The team ended up including:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Not less than 10 stakeholders.</li>

            <li>2 visual designers.</li>

            <li>
              1 Full Stack Developer working on the back end, middle layer and
              the web components.
            </li>

            <li>1 Front End Developer (me) styling the web components.</li>

            <li>1 UX Researcher conducting the concept and usability tests.</li>

            <li>
              1 UX Designer (me) keeping track of and processing all of the
              information coming in from all the different channels.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With a team of close to 20 people involved with the project,
            including everyone in every decision would be difficult.
            Communication to those not involved in decision-making and
            collaborative working sessions was going to be crucial.

          <h2>The Design Process</h2>

          <p>
            Varying opinions and numerous stakeholder ideas made user testing
            and validation crucial for the design of the new Resource Search. I
            viewed my role as a neutral observer to the differing opinions and
            served as an impartial conduit to creating and testing assets to
            discover which ideas users preferred.
          </p>

          <p>
            The design process started with 3 ideas from 3 different people:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Idea 1 had a series of filter groups above the results.</li>
            <li>
              Idea 2 had a series of filter groups in a column to the left of
              the results.
            </li>
            <li>
              Idea 3 had a series of toggles that displayed the different filter
              groups one at a time above the results.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I took the 3 ideas and rendered them all as interactive prototypes
            in Balsamiq for a round of concept testing.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <picture>
              <source
                srcset="/img/resources-3-concepts.webp"
                type="image/webp"
              />
              <source srcset="/img/resources-3-concepts.png" type="image/png" />
              <img
                src="/img/resources-3-concepts.png"
                class="bordered"
                aria-hidden="true"
                role="presentation"
                alt=""
              />
            </picture>
            <figcaption>

              Balsamiq.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            All 3 of the ideas tested well, but when asked which the users
            preferred the result was unanimous… Idea 2 was the concept users
            preferred.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            With the ambient layout of the solution in place I took over design
            duties and began working on the content that would live in the
            layout. To inform the design decisions I was soon to make I:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Studied the search functionality of other sites.</li>
            <li>
              Did heuristic research on how search results should be displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worked with developers to develop the data model that would feed
              the results so I know exactly what I could display.
            </li>
            <li>
              Talked with stakeholders about what they viewed was important to
              display.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With all of this information I began working on a more refined
            wireframe in Balsamiq.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Using the data model I determined what info I thought was valuable
              and used typography and value to illustrate that importance.
            </li>

            <li>
              We had questions on if and where we should display a thumbnail of
              the result. Nielsen Norman Group has a
              <a
                href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-list-thumbnail/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >wonderful flowchart</a
              >
              that helps decide when and where to use a thumbnail image. Using
              the flow chart showed that we should put a thumbnail on the right
              hand side of the search result.
            </li>

            <li>
              One stakeholder requirement was to have 2 views of the result (an
              expanded view with more info and a condensed view to show more
              results on the screen) so I built this option into the prototype.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We went into the next round of testing with a series of questions
            that drilled into the usefulness of pretty much all of the pieces of
            information we displayed.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            We got very precise feedback on the questions we had asked
            including:
          </p>

          <div class="two-up--flex">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="/img/resources-test2-parsing.jpg"
                class="bordered"

              <figcaption>Parsing the results of Concept test 2.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Condensed View was missing too many items and was
                  confusing. The lack of a thumbnail and icon made it difficult
                  to tell what type of resource the item was when scanning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Thumbnail position was unanimously validated. Users felt
                  that title and type was more important than image.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The inclusion of a URL to the Resource Detail page was
                  questioned becasue all of the Resources live under the same
                  domain, unlike a Search Engine.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            At this point I had a very good sense of what the design needed to
            be so it was time to increase fidelity. Besides doing the UX work
            for this project I was also the Front End Developer, so instead of
            working in Sketch I chose to move to the Browser.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            While the initial concept and testing were being done, the Back End
            of the Resources Search was being written. It consists of
            <a
              href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Elastic Search</a
            >
            Indexes that talk to a series of Web Components via a layer of PHP
            to generate the search results and display them in the browser. My
            job from this point forward was to style the Front End to match the
            designs we had been working on up until that point.
          </p>

          <p>
            When development was complete we went back for one more round of
            Usability Testing with the actual production code before it was
            released. Test results were overwhelming positive again, with quotes
            like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Super straightforward, and easy to use”</li>
            <li>
              “I can see exactly what I’m looking for, E-books, technical
              papers, the title is clear, I really like it”
            </li>
            <li>
              “I like how the filters are all open, no need to click anything
              additional and the sort is great!”
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With validation in hand we presented the solution to stakeholders.
            We got an enthusiastic sign-off from them and released to
            production.
