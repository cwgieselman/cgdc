  <p>
    Companies large and small use Jamf Pro to manage their fleet of Apple
    devices. Jamf Pro allows IT administrators to remotely send commands and
    configurations directly to those devices, so users can remain productive. We
    wanted to leverage Jamf Pro’s relationship with enrolled devices to offer a
    personalized, secure experience on a shared device. A pair of iOS apps, one
    for the configuration and one for the resetting of the device was the
    Product Owner’s solution.

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    How can we leverage Jamf Pro’s relationship with enrolled devices to offer a
    personalized, secure experience on a shared device?
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Some Organizations may elect to allow employees to share devices for work
      purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
      This presents a challenge for IT as each user wants their work and
      personal information to remain private even when using a shared device.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expecting each user to have the know-how to manually configure or reset
      their device each time is impractical
    </li>
    <li>
      Requiring IT to manually do so can be tedious and unrealistic as IT may
      not always know who is accessing what device and when.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User & Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The target users of the Jamf Setup and Jamf Reset apps are those who
    leverage an iOS device to complete their daily work responsibilities.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      There is a good chance that the user has never heard of Mobile Device
      Management or knows what Jamf Pro is.
    </li>
    <li>
      They will be familiar with iOS and know how to utilize it to complete
      their daily tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Simplicity and a native iOS feel will be important to these users as they
      will want to spend as little time as possible configuring the device so
      that they can focus on work productivity.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Team & Role</h2>
  <p>
    I was the primary UX Designer for both the Setup and Reset apps. I worked
    extensively with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Product Owner to capture requirements.</li>
    <li>A UX Researcher to test User Flows and interactions</li>
    <li>
      2 iOS Developers to ensure that everything designed and tested made it to
      the final apps.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Design Process</h2>

  <p>
    Configuring an individual device for multiple unique users was not a new
    problem. We knew there was desire for this functionality from feature
    requests as well as through partnerships with customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We started Jamf Setup with a prototype application that allowed end-users to
    apply settings back to Jamf Pro from their devices.
  </p>

    </picture>
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Instead of applying settings on an individual basis, we restructured the
    prototype to present the user with a simple list of familiar options that
    would map back to Configuration Profiles in Jamf Pro. The user would pick a
    profile and all of the settings and configuration would come to them.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    With the new prototype in place we developed a realistic workflow that a
    user might follow before and after a shift.
  </p>

  <figure aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
    <picture>
      <source srcset="img/setup-reset-workflow.webp" type="image/webp" />
      <source srcset="img/setup-reset-workflow.png" type="image/jpeg" />
      <img src="img/setup-reset-workflow.png" class="bordered" alt="" />
    </picture>
    <figcaption>
      User's workflow for configuring and wiping a shared device
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The restructuring of the prototype app for Jamf Setup simplified the User
    Flow significantly, so much so that we were left with a one screen
    application. We knew that Jamf Reset would be just as simple.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Armed with our prototype app and workflow we matched each step in the
    workflow with an interaction to build our User Flow.
  </p>

  <figure aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
    <picture>
      <source srcset="img/setup-reset-userflow.webp" type="image/webp" />
      <source srcset="img/setup-reset-userflow.png" type="image/jpeg" />
      <img src="img/setup-reset-userflow.png" class="bordered" alt="" />
    </picture>
    <figcaption>Basic interactions mapped over our workflow.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Each app consisted of a single interaction point and required two distinct
    actions before any backend process began. We worked to make the experience
    of using the apps feel like they belonged together and were the ‘bookends’
    of using an iOS device as a tool to complete their daily tasks.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    At this point we had a prototype app, a workflow, and our User Flow, so it
    was time to start pushing pixels.
  </p>

  <figure aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
    <picture>
      <source srcset="img/reset-userflow.webp" type="image/webp" />
      <source srcset="img/reset-userflow.png" type="image/jpeg" />

      Flow.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Here we began taking into account possible errors and failures on the
    backend of the application and how to relay such information to the user.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Once we were happy with our User Flows we built an end-to-end static
    prototype to test everything we had designed.
  </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
    A series of user tests were ran using our InVision prototype. Results were
    favorable, so the iOS Developers took the screens and began building the
    final apps.

  <h2>Interface Design</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      We leaned heavily on the Apple iOS Interface Guidelines as we wanted the
      experience to look and feel as close to native as possible.
    </p>

    <div class="two-up--flex">

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
      The apps were designed with generic branding in the form of a banner
      graphic and a matching button color. We also had to take into account that
      these apps would have customization options. The IT Administrator who
      managed the apps would have the ability to add their own branding via the
      Managed App Configuration (MAC) File. Customization included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>replacing the banner graphic</li>
      <li>changing the background and button color</li>
      <li>modifying the headline and body copy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We provided some constraints (max width and height of the graphic and the
      number of lines of copy) and I took care in the layout so that the iOS
      Developers could leverage
      <a

      for consistent rendering.

    <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
    <p>
      Because we wanted to maintain a native feel, the interactions needed came
      directly from iOS.

      We also used a

        target="_blank"

    </p>
    <p>
      The final interaction proved to be the most complicated to solve. Once the
      configuration was received and executed, how should the user exit the app
      to use the device? iOS Guidelines specifically state that an app cannot be
      closed automatically, as it equates to the app crashing. Our solution
      ended up coming directly from the final screen in the installation of iOS
      on a device... Instruct the user to press Home Button.

      Jamf Setup and Reset were given to partners for Beta testing. Feedback was
      positive so they were released into the Apple App Store; you can see
