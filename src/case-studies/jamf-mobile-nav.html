    The
    <a href="https://www.jamf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Jamf Corporate website</a
    >
    uses a disclosure-based pattern affectionately referred to as the ‘Drawer’
    for navigation. Because the drawer did not translate well to small screens,
    we needed to design an experience that was as easy to use and as capable as
    the Drawer was on large screens. Through iteration and testing we ended up
    adapting the Drawer itself to work on small screens.

  <h2>The Problem</h2>

  <p>
    The navbar consists of a series of toggles that each disclose a Drawer
    containing content and links. The Drawer slides into view from under the
    navbar. When subnav links are needed, they appear in a darker gray bar that
    runs just underneath the global navbar.
  </p>

  <p>
    The horizontal nature of the bars does not work on small screens. Because of
    this, we used a second set of links for our small screen navigation. This
    set of links was hidden on large screens via Media Query. The Drawer toggles
    were hidden on small screens in the same manner.

    <div>
      <p>
        This small screen solution presented UX issues. This long and loosely
        structured list of links could be very disorienting to the user.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To account for all the links available in the Drawer, we used logic to
          hide/show contextual links and sometimes breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was difficult to retain a sense of place because the display was
          always subtly changing.
        </li>
        <li>Some links were unavailable on small screens all together.</li>
        <li>
          Because you only saw sibling links under a parent there was no way to
          traverse the site from a subpage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    We pondered how we could provide a navigation experience on small screen
    that was comparable in ability to its large screen counterpart. With the
    problem defined I went to work.

  <h2>The Design Process</h2>

  <p>
    I spent no time with pencil and paper or in Sketch at the beginning of this
    project; instead I designed in the browser using the existing markup. I
    thought critically about the mechanics of the Drawer on a large screen and
    how I could translate the Drawer to a smaller area.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It occurred to me that our existing small-screen navigation transitioned
      into view in the exact same way the Drawer did on large screens.
    </li>
    <li>
      The issue with using this pattern on the small screen wasn’t the drawer
      itself, but it was the toggles. How could they take up less horizontal
      space?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I recalled the small screen nav of
    <a href="https://www.espn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >espn.com</a
    >. It had a series of skinny links running vertically along the left side of
    the screen with more links in the larger division.
  </p>

  <p>
    My Aha moment was correlating this ESPN navigation to our large screen
    Drawer-based navigation turned on it's side.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Some heuristic experts say that
    <a
      href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >upper left is a bad place for buttons</a
    >
    because of the stretch it takes to reach a thumb across the screen for right
    handed users. Taking this into account my first prototype had the hamburger
    menu on the right hand side of the navbar with all of the elements (toggles,
    Drawer, and any subnav links) sliding in from right to left.
  </p>

  <div class="two-up--flex">
    <figure aria-hidden="true" role="presentation">
      <video
        class="bordered"
        controls
        width="300"

      >
        <source src="/img/mobile-nav-prototype-1.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="/img/mobile-nav-prototype-1.ogg" type="video/ogg" />

        coming from the right.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div>
      <p>
        Not bad... I immediately felt a strong correlation between the large and
        small screen experiences. It was not without issues though.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because we read left to right, sliding the content from the right felt
          unnatural.
        </li>
        <li>
          The pacing of the transition felt rushed, especially when subnav links
          were involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          The subnav links took up most of the main content area when the nav
          was engaged.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

    Taking these thoughts into account I went to work on the second iteration.

      <figcaption>The second iteration after implementing feedback.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I moved the hamburger to the left side of the navbar and had the
          drawer toggles slide in from the left. I took the ergonomics into
          account in this decision, but a quick scan of popular sites and apps
          showed that left side nav is used as often as right side. I also
          polled other designers and they agreed that it felt more natural for
          everything to flow left to right.
        </li>
        <li>
          I slowed the transition slightly and applied some easing to make it
          feel less rushed and give it some character.
        </li>
        <li>I removed the Subnav links all together for the time being.</li>
        <li>
          To bring the look and feel closer to the large screen interface I
          mimicked its hover and active states for the toggles.
        </li>
        <li>
          I also experimented with having the drawer disclose from the top, as
          it does on the large screen version.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <hr />

  <p>
    I sought more feedback, this time from a senior member of the UX team. We
    inferred that when a user clicks the hamburger the expectation is to see
    links, not another series of options to click to get to links. To solve this
    we decided that it would be better for one of the drawers to open with the
    toggles.

        Iteration 3 felt like a complete and workable solution.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Drawer and toggles would slide on to the screen in one fluid
          motion from left to right.
        </li>
        <li>
          The navigation would take over the entire screen leaving no doubt what
          the interaction was.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ability to completely close the drawer was removed on small
          screens. Tapping the toggle of an open drawer would do nothing.
        </li>
        <li>
          To tighten the correlation between the active toggle and its Drawer I
          changed the background color of the active toggle to match the drawer
          background.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <hr />

  <p>
    Iteration 4 was all about reintroducing the subnav links that were removed
    from the solution earlier in the process. At this point I broke out the
    pencil and paper to ideate. I felt that designing in the browser might not
    be the most effective method of rendering my sketches, so instead I build
    static prototypes of my 2 best ideas (one in Figma and one in InVision). I
    also arranged usability testing for these 2 options.

          The second candidate, built in InVision, put the subnav links in a
          collapsing accordion that toggled with a caret next to the parent
          link.

  <p>
    While neither failed usability tests, the time on task for the second
    candidate was significantly less than the first, so I built that into the
    the solution.

    After 4 iterations, numerous feedback sessions, and a round of usability
    testing we had a solution that was worthy of presenting to stakeholders.
    Feedback was unanimously positive, so the prototype was rolled into the
    site's codebase and prepped for production release. The solution can be seen
    on
    <a href="https://www.jamf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >jamf.com</a

    as we speak. There are plans for

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Jamf Nation</a

    to adpot the pattern as well. I have built a prototype of Jamf Nation's IA
    using the nav and am consulting on its implementation.
