    Hi! I'm Craig.

      standards-based markup are my thing.</span

  <p>
    Proper and efficient input/output of content and data fall on Web standards.
    I have dedicated my career to designing and rendering interfaces using these
    standards.

  <h2>I work where users & content meet.</h2>

  <a>Come see what I mean</a>
