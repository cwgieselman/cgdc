  <h1>Hi! I'm Craig.</h1>
  <p>
    I donâ€™t know what to call what I do, but inclusive design and
    standards-based markup are my thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proper and efficient input/output of content and data fall on Web standards.
    I have dedicated my career to designing and rendering interfaces using these
    standards.
  </p>

  <p>I work where users & content meet.</p>

  <a>Come see what I mean</a>
